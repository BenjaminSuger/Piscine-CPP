# C++ Piscine

## What is the C++ Piscine ?

This was a project in the 42 school curriculum, meant to introduce you to the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Paradigm and C++.   
All exercises needed to be in the C++98 standard to focus only on the essential parts.

There were 10 modules, each with a various number of exercises.    
Each module focused on a few concepts: Class, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Cast, etc.  
The main goal was to make you learn C++ after a long time using C (which is the main programming language of the cursus).


**Module00**; learn cin, cout, cerr / Class / private vs public  
**Module01** ; pointer vs reference / new & delete / pointers to functions  
**Module02** ; override / fixed point representation  
**Module03** ; inheritance    
**Module04** ; abstract class, interface, deep vs shallow copy    


This "piscine" does not exist anymore in the new 42 curriculum.

## Bonus Part

For some exercises, as we had some limitations (such as not using the STL...) and were forced to use only C++98, I made extra versions to explore more subjects. Each time, they are in directories ending with "_bonus".
